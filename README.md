# Sales Prediction Modeling
====================================================================================

In this project, I aimed to create two models who attempt to predict a given outlet's sales numbers based on a several store metrics.
Given the

+ Item Weight
+ Item Fat Content
+ Item Visibility
+ Item Type
+ Item Manufacturer Retail Price
+ Outlet Size
+ Year of Establishment 
+ Type of Establishment

====================================================================================
# Visualizations included were

+ Total Store Sales Based on Year Store was Established
   -Historically steady sales, with a recent downturn for newer stores
+ Store Tierâ€™s Compared to Total Store Sales
   -Tier 3 stores have greater potential sales than others, but lower total sales on average.

# Conclusion

====================================================================================
for the store, a linear regression and tree regression models were crafted using Pandas, Numpy, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
These models were tested on a 6000+ item training se and tested on a 2000+ item test set.
Their performance was subsuquently evaluated using R^2 and RMSE metrics. These findings are summarized in the PowerPoint presentation provided.
